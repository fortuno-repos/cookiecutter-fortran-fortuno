Cookiecutter-Fortran-Fortuno
****************************

Cookiecutter-Fortran-Fortuno offers templates for setting up a Fortran project,
allowing you to select from various build systems (currently CMake and Fpm are
implemented, Meson is in progress), as well as different
parallelization models such as serial, MPI, and coarray. The resulting project
will include a library, unit tests utilizing the `Fortuno
<https://fortuno.readthedocs.io>`_ unit testing framework, and optionally a
standalone application and an example.


Usage
=====

Installing cookiecutter
-----------------------

You must have cookiecutter and Python installed on your system. If cookiecutter
is not already installed, you can add it using pip. For Linux users, the
following commands can be used:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p ~/opt/venv
    python3 -m venv ~/opt/venv/cookiecutter
    source ~/opt/venv/cookiecutter/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install cookiecutter

This will install cookiecutter in a virtual environment under
``~/opt/venv/cookiecutter``. Note that you need to activate the virtual
environment every time you want to use cookiecutter later by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    source ~/opt/venv/cookiecutter/bin/activate

For further details and other ways of installing cookiecutter, consult the
`cookiecutter installation instructions
<https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_.


Generating a new Fortran project
--------------------------------

To generate a new Fortran project, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    cookiecutter gh:fortuno-repos/cookiecutter-fortran-fortuno

You will be asked to choose the build system and parallelization model for your
project, along with additional details about it. The project will be generated
in a new folder named according to the ``project_slug`` you provide. This folder
will contain a complete, ready-to-build, run, test, and install project.
